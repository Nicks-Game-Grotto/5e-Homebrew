_**Prerequisite:** Requires a Strength score greater than 13_

**The following features only apply when a character is wearing medium or heavy armor and mounted on a warhorse wearing barding.**

#### Horse Armor

+2 to AC against non-magical attacks.

#### Master Lancer

Ignore disadvantage on attack rolls for targets within 5ft when wielding a lance.

#### Advanced Trampling

If the horse moves at least 15 feet straight toward a creature it can pass through 3 medium or smaller creatures in a line, the creature must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone and take 2d6 bludgeoning damage. The horse can then use the trampling charge on it's final target. When combined with the dash action the number of targeted creatures increases to 5, but the player can not use trampling charge at the end.

The mount can perform this action twice per short rest before it starts to take levels of exhaustion for each additional use. Half as many usages when combined with dash. The mount can be pushed past the 5th level of exhaustion. The mount can be pushed to death using this action.

**Examples:**  
Use advanced trample; 3 times in combat and the horse takes 1 level of exhaustion, 2 times with dash action and the horse takes 2 levels of exhaustion, 1 time without dash and 1 time with dash and the horse takes 1 level of exhaustion. 4 times with dash and the horse dies of exhaustion.

#### Expert Rider

You have proficiency with Animal Handling for any rolls that apply to mounted movement/combat.  
Double proficiency with Animal Handling if you already have it.

If your mount gets spooked/scared you can ease the mount as a reaction with a DC10 Animal Handling roll.

Finally, mounting or dismounting a creature costs you only 10 feet of movement, rather than half your speed.
