Skill Challenge is a mechanic designed to simulate a series of tasks or obstacles that require the collective effort of the player characters. The Game Master (GM) sets the scene, outlining the challenge and the specific skills that can be employed by the players to overcome it.

The standard Skill Challenge typically consists of a series of skill checks that the players need to succeed in order to accomplish the overall goal. Each player takes turns describing how their character contributes to the group's efforts and then makes a skill check based on the chosen action. The success or failure of each check contributes to the overall success or failure of the challenge. *GMs are strongly encouraged to ensure that players utilize different skills for each roll and prevent any player from using the same skill consecutively.*

## Skill Challenge Rules:

**1. Setting the Scene:**

- Describe the challenge or task at hand. This could be anything from navigating a treacherous mountain path to convincing a group of hostile NPCs to stand down.

**2. Establish the Objective:**

- Clearly define the goal of the Skill Challenge. What needs to be accomplished for the players to succeed? This could be accumulating a certain number of successful skill checks before a certain number of failures, or reaching a specific threshold of success within a given time frame.

**3. Determine Difficulty:**

- Set the DC (Difficulty Class) for each skill check. The DC can vary based on the complexity of the task. For example, climbing a steep mountain might have a higher DC than convincing a guard to let you through.

**4. Player Turns:**

- In a Skill Challenge, each player has a turn during which they describe how they want to use a skill to contribute to the group's success. Players should choose skills that make sense for the situation. For example, using Acrobatics to navigate a narrow ledge or Persuasion to calm a hostile NPC.

**5. Skill Checks:**

- Players roll a skill check, and the result is compared to the DC. If the roll meets or exceeds the DC, it's a success. If it falls short, it's a failure. The GM describes the outcome of the player's action based on the result.

**6. Variety of Skills:**

- Encourage players to use a variety of skills to keep the challenge dynamic. Avoid allowing the same skill to be used in consecutive turns unless the players come up with a creative reason for doing so.

**7. Group Cooperation:**

- Players can describe how they're helping each other, providing advantage to one another's rolls. This emphasizes teamwork.

**8. Consequences:**

- Determine consequences for failure and success. A failed Skill Challenge might lead to setbacks or additional complications, while success brings the party closer to their objective.

**9. Narrate the Progress:**

- As the players succeed or fail, narrate how the situation is evolving. Describe how their actions impact the overall challenge.

**10. Conclusion:**

- Once the players reach the required number of successes or failures, the Skill Challenge concludes. Describe the final outcome based on their performance.

### Example Scenario:

_The party is navigating through a dense forest, trying to catch up with a band of kidnappers. The objective is to track the kidnappers and rescue the hostages. The Skill Challenge requires a total of 6 successful skill checks before accumulating 3 failures._

- Player 1: "I want to use Survival to track the kidnappers' footprints." (Rolls a 15, succeeds)
- Player 2: "I'll use Perception to listen for any sounds or signs of movement ahead." (Rolls a 12, succeeds)
- Player 3: "I'll use Nature to identify any plants or terrain features that might give us clues." (Rolls a 10, succeeds)

Continue this process until the players succeed or fail the Skill Challenge.

Adapting and customizing the Skill Challenge rules based on your campaign and players' preferences can make them an engaging and memorable addition to your tabletop RPG sessions.

When setting up a Skill Challenge, the difficulty and length are crucial elements that help determine the challenge's complexity and intensity. Here's how to configure these parameters effectively:

### 1. Setting the Difficulty Class (DC)

The Difficulty Class (DC) is a numerical value that players must meet or exceed on their d20 roll, added to their relevant skill modifier, to achieve a success in the challenge. The DC represents how hard the tasks within the challenge are. Here are suggested DC levels based on the desired challenge difficulty:

- **Easy Challenge: DC 12** - This might be used for simple tasks where the risk of failure is relatively low but still present.
- **Medium Challenge: DC 15** - A standard level of difficulty for challenges that require competence and a bit of ingenuity.
- **Hard Challenge: DC 18** - Suitable for tasks that are significantly challenging, requiring skill and often luck to succeed.

### 2. Determining the Length of the Challenge

The length of the challenge is expressed through a ratio of wins to losses (successes/failures), indicating how many successes the players need to achieve the challenge’s objective and how many failures will result in a negative outcome. This ratio also helps to determine the pace and tension of the challenge:

- **Quick Challenge (4/3):** This ratio means the players need 4 successes before accumulating 3 failures. It’s suitable for fast-paced, brief scenarios like a car chase. This is the typical length for most Skill Challenges.
- **Medium Challenge (6/4):** Requiring 6 successes before reaching 4 failures, this setting works well for moderately complex scenarios like planning and executing a jewelry heist.
- **Long Challenge (8/5):** Designed for extended and intricate scenarios, such as orchestrating a siege on a castle, where players need 8 successes and can afford up to 5 failures.

### Alternate Rules

Here’s an enhanced approach that utilizes a fixed Difficulty Class (DC) for the entire challenge, with an option for increased difficulty and potential rewards:

1. **Set the Fixed Difficulty Class (DC):** At the beginning of the Skill Challenge, the GM sets a fixed DC that will apply to most skill checks throughout the challenge. This DC reflects the general difficulty of the tasks the characters are attempting to accomplish.
2. **Conducting Skill Checks:** Players take turns describing how they utilize their characters' skills to overcome the challenge. Each player rolls a d20, adds the relevant skill modifier, and attempts to meet or exceed the fixed DC.
3. **Option for Increased Difficulty:** If a player wants to undertake an action that is exceptionally challenging, the GM has the discretion to increase the DC by up to 3 points. This reflects the increased risk but also the potential for greater impact on the challenge.
4. **Reward for Elevated Risk:** Should a player succeed on this more difficult check, the next player in sequence receives advantage on their roll. This represents the momentum gained by the previous player's exceptional success.
5. **Narrative Consequences:** The GM describes the results of each skill check, detailing how the characters' actions affect the ongoing scenario. Successes move the group closer to their objective, while failures introduce complications or setbacks.
6. **Tracking Progress:** The challenge continues until the players accumulate a predetermined number of successes or reach the limit of allowed failures. These thresholds are set by the GM based on the complexity of the challenge and the stakes involved.
7. **Uniform Challenge Level with Flexibility:** Although a single DC simplifies the challenge, the option to increase the DC for specific high-risk actions adds depth and variety to player choices, encouraging strategic thinking and creative problem-solving.
8. **Concluding the Challenge:** The GM concludes the Skill Challenge by narrating the outcome based on the players’ successes and failures, shaping the future of the story according to their actions.

This approach to Skill Challenges not only simplifies the process but also introduces a dynamic element where players can choose to take bigger risks for potentially greater rewards, enhancing both the tactical and narrative layers of the game.

# Combat Challenge

For combat encounters with fixed lengths, such as a duel, or in time-constrained scenarios like a one-shot, the GM can effectively utilize the Combat Challenge rules to maintain a brisk pace while still delivering a rich and exciting experience. By setting a specific number of rounds for the duel or challenge (e.g., five rounds for a duel DCxx 3/2), the GM ensures that the encounter remains tense and dynamic without overstaying its welcome. This approach allows for a tightly scripted sequence where each player action and GM reaction becomes crucial, emphasizing strategic gameplay and quick decision-making. Additionally, for one-shots or other short sessions, these rules enable the GM to integrate meaningful combat into the narrative without requiring extensive setup or prolonged encounters, keeping the session within the desired timeframe and ensuring that players remain engaged from start to finish.

To incorporate a Combat Challenge into a Skill Challenge, you can use the following alternate rules. These rules allow for more dynamic interaction between skill checks and combat actions, blending the tactical elements of both:

## Player Actions
Each player has several options during their turn in a round of the Combat Challenge:

1. **Skill Checks:** Players can roll skill checks against the Skill Challenge DC to contribute towards the challenge's success count. The skill chosen should be appropriate to the narrative situation.

2. **Make an Attack:** Players may choose to make a weapon or spell attack against a DC equivalent to the Skill Challenge DC. A successful attack counts as a success for the challenge.

3. **Cast Spells:**
   - **Aid Spells:** Spells that directly aid another PC don't require a roll unless the spell specifically requires one. Any aid given can potentially grant a bonus of up to +3 on the aided player’s next roll.
   - **AOE or Control Spells:** When a player casts an area of effect (AOE) or control spell, the GM makes a roll against the player’s spell save DC. A failure by the GM counts as a success for the players, and vice versa. This reflects the strategic impact of the spell on the field.

## GM Actions
The GM also has multiple options to interact with the players during a Combat Challenge, making the encounter dynamic and reactive:

1. **NPC Reactions:**
   - **Attack:** For every attack made by a player, the GM can counter with one NPC attack. This maintains the balance and threat level of the encounter.

2. **Skill Checks or Spells:** The GM can use skill checks or cast spells to influence the battle:
   - **Aid Another NPC:** Similar to players, the GM can use actions to give advantage on another NPC’s roll, affecting the ongoing dynamics of the challenge.
   - **Resolve Effects:** The GM can also resolve effects that either aid or challenge the players. This might give the players an additional success or failure based on the NPCs' actions and spells.
   - **Advantage/Disadvantage:** The GM can resolve actions that grant advantages or impose disadvantages on player rolls, such as a bonus or penalty of up to +/-3 on their next roll depending on the effectiveness of the NPC’s actions.

## Playing the Combat Challenge
During the Combat Challenge, turns should proceed with each player choosing their action based on the tactical needs of the moment and their character’s strengths. The GM then reacts accordingly, keeping the tension and pacing appropriate to a combat scenario. This model ensures that both strategic planning and random chance influence the outcome, keeping each session exciting and unpredictable.

By blending skill checks with combat actions, this set of rules enriches the traditional Skill Challenge, making it more engaging for players who enjoy both the narrative depth of skillful problem solving and the immediacy of combat encounters.

For the rules below rewrite it as if setting a number for the entire challenge was the only way to play a skill challenge. The GM sets a target number, known as the Difficulty Class (DC), for each skill check. The DC represents the level of difficulty for the task at hand. Players must roll a d20 and add their relevant skill modifier to meet or exceed the DC. The GM narrates the consequences of success or failure, and the players continue to make skill checks until they accumulate enough successes to complete the challenge or until they reach a predetermined number of failures, resulting in failure. An alternative rule to add variety is the use of a set DC for the entire challenge. Instead of assigning a different DC for each skill check, the GM establishes a fixed Difficulty Class that the players must consistently meet or exceed. This simplifies the tracking process, streamlining the Skill Challenge and placing a greater emphasis on the narrative aspects of the players' actions. This approach allows for flexibility and adaptability, enabling the GM to focus more on the storytelling and creative aspects of the challenge rather than strict adherence to individual skill difficulties. It encourages players to think creatively about how their characters can contribute to the challenge and fosters a more dynamic and immersive gameplay experience.

For Skill Challenges in Dungeons & Dragons 5e, here's a streamlined approach that focuses on setting a single Difficulty Class (DC) for the entire challenge:

1. **Set the Difficulty Class (DC):** At the start of the Skill Challenge, the Game Master (GM) establishes a fixed DC that applies to all skill checks made during the challenge. This DC reflects the overall difficulty of the scenario the characters are facing.
    
2. **Skill Checks:** Players take turns describing how their characters use their abilities to tackle the challenge. For each action, they must roll a d20 and add their relevant skill modifier, aiming to meet or exceed the fixed DC set by the GM.
    
3. **Narration of Outcomes:** Based on whether the players succeed or fail their rolls, the GM narrates the immediate consequences of their actions. This narration is crucial as it drives the story forward and highlights the impact of each character's contributions.
    
4. **Progress Tracking:** The group must accumulate a predetermined number of successes before they reach a set number of failures. The GM decides these totals based on the complexity and significance of the challenge.
    
5. **Uniform Challenge Level:** Using a set DC for all checks simplifies gameplay by removing the need to recalibrate the difficulty for each action. This allows both players and the GM to focus more on the narrative flow and the creative execution of the challenge.
    
6. **Flexibility in Action:** Even with a single DC, players are encouraged to use a variety of skills. The GM can facilitate this by interpreting how different skills could logically apply to the situation, maintaining engagement and encouraging creative solutions.
    
7. **Conclusion:** Once the requisite number of successes or failures has been reached, the GM describes the outcome of the challenge, detailing how the characters' efforts have shaped the progression of the story.
    

This set DC approach simplifies the mechanical aspects of Skill Challenges and shifts the emphasis towards storytelling and player creativity. It fosters a more streamlined and engaging experience, making it ideal for GMs who prefer to keep gameplay fast-paced and focused on the narrative.

Now rewrite the previous rules and include a rule that says the gm can increase the DC for an individual check if the player wants to try and do something extraordinarily difficult. In this case increase the DC by a maximum 3 points. If the player succeeds this check the next player gets advantage on their roll.

Describe how to set the difficulty and length for a skill challenge using the following text ***Skill Challenge*** **DC 15 4/3**. Players take one turn per round describing what their player will do, then roll against the Challenge DC to determine success or failure. Three fails always results in a negative outcome for the party, and the number of successes changes depending on the difficulty, this is expressed as a DC followed by a ratio like this **DC 10-25 wins/losses**. Suggest a difficulty of 12 for an easy challenge, 15 for medium, and 18 for hard. Describe the ratio wins/losses as the length of the challenge. 4/3 is a quick challenge like a car chase where 6/4 is medium like a jewelry heist and 8/5 is long like a castle siege

### Example Setup: Medium Difficulty Castle Siege

If you're setting up a castle siege and want it to be a long and hard challenge, you might choose a setup like **DC 18 8/5**. This means:

- Players need to achieve 8 successes before they reach 5 failures.
- Each success or failure is determined by a player rolling a d20 and adding the appropriate skill modifier, aiming to meet or exceed a DC of 18.
- The challenge is intense and complex, suitable for a high-stakes scenario like a siege.

### How to Play a Skill Challenge

1. **Introduction:** The GM describes the scenario and states the challenge’s DC and success/failure ratio.
2. **Player Turns:** Players describe what actions their characters take to contribute to overcoming the challenge. They choose which skills to use based on their descriptions and the situation.
3. **Skill Checks:** For each action, the player rolls a d20, adds the relevant skill modifier, and compares the result to the set DC.
4. **Narrate Outcomes:** The GM describes the immediate effects of each attempt, whether successful or not, and how it influences the overall scenario.
5. **Track Progress:** Keep a tally of successes and failures. Continue until the players either achieve the necessary number of successes to win or accumulate enough failures to lose.
6. **Conclusion:** Wrap up the challenge by narrating the outcomes of the players' actions and detailing the subsequent events in the story.

Using this structured approach not only enhances the gaming experience by adding depth and excitement but also keeps players engaged through active participation and strategic decision-making.
