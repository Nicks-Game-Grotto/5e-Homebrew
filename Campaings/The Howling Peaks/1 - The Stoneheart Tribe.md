# The Howling Peaks at the Shrine of the Everflow
## Chapter One: The Stoneheart Tribe's Call

---

### Setting the Stage

Nestled in the shadow of the towering **Skyreach Peaks**, the **Stoneheart Tribe**, a community of resilient Goliaths, clings to survival amidst the harsh elements. Each year, as the icy grip of winter loosens, they gather to perform the **Meltwater Covenant**, an ancient spring ritual that ensures the snow and ice of the mountains melt, replenishing the fertile fields of the **Verdant Steppe**. Without this sacred rite, the migratory herds that sustain their way of life may never return.

But this year, the Meltwater Covenant is in jeopardy. The **Shrine of the Everflow**, a temple hidden deep within the mountains, has gone silent. The **Windspeakers**, the tribe's spiritual leaders, are in disarray. Two of the four shamans have gone missing—one vanished while investigating the shrine, and another never returned after leading a hunting party into the peaks twenty days ago. The remaining Windspeakers and the tribe’s **Chieftain, Harrok Stonemane**, have grown desperate. If the shrine remains sealed and the rite unperformed, the tribe faces starvation and ruin.

The **Council of Stone**, an advisory body of seasoned elders, has convened to decide the tribe's next steps. Though they remain divided, they agree on one thing: the tribe must find heroes to journey to the shrine, uncover its mysteries, and ensure the Meltwater Covenant is performed.

### The Meltwater Covenant

The **Meltwater Covenant** is the centerpiece of the Stoneheart Tribe’s spring rites. This solemn ritual involves summoning the spirits of water and earth to awaken the mountain’s snowmelt, ensuring it flows down into the Verdant Steppe. Performed at the **Shrine of the Everflow**, it is led by the Windspeakers and attended by the tribe as they sing ancient chants and offer sacred herbs and totems.

### Flavor Text (Introduction to the Players)

> **The winds howl through the Skyreach Peaks, carrying with them the sharp bite of snow and the weight of desperation. The Stoneheart Tribe gathers in a solemn circle, their faces carved from stone yet marked by worry. The great bonfire in the center of their camp crackles weakly, its embers seeming to mirror their flickering hope. Chieftain Harrok Stonemane steps forward, his voice booming over the icy gale.**
>
> “For generations, the mountains have tested our mettle, but we have never faltered. Now, the shrine lies silent, and our people vanish in the night. The Meltwater Covenant must be performed, or our herds will not return, and our children will go hungry. Brave souls are needed—heroes willing to face the unknown and bring back the light of the Everflow. Will you answer the call?”
>
> **The eyes of the tribe turn toward you, their hope resting on your shoulders. The wind bites at your skin, but within your chest, a spark ignites. The journey ahead will not be easy, but the fate of the Stoneheart Tribe—and the ancient covenant—depends on your courage.**
