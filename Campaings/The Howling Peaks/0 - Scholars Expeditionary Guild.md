# Prologue: The Howling Peaks at the Shrine of the Everflow

## Candlekeep and the Scholars’ Expeditionary Guild

The fortress-library of **Candlekeep**, perched on a cliff along the Sword Coast, stands as the most extensive repository of knowledge in Faerûn. Within its hallowed halls, the **Scholars’ Expeditionary Guild** (SEG) operates as an elite faction of adventurers and academics. Guild members are dispatched to recover lost knowledge, investigate ancient mysteries, and retrieve artifacts of historical and arcane significance. Though perilous, such work often reveals secrets that shape the very history of the Realms.

Your group of adventurers is one of Candlekeep’s most accomplished teams. After years of expeditions—from the ruins of Netherese enclaves to the frozen reaches of Icewind Dale—your group has become a well-oiled machine. United by Candlekeep’s patronage and your own shared bonds, you now face one of your most daunting challenges: investigating the plight of the **Stoneheart Tribe** and their connection to the **Shrine of the Everflow**, a mysterious temple deep within the **Skyreach Peaks**.

3. **Unique Relics**: Rumors of powerful magical artifacts tied to elemental forces swirl around the shrine. The guild sees this as a chance to secure powerful items for study—and to prevent them from falling into the wrong hands.
4. **Personal Stakes**: The Pathfinder’s mentor vanished during an earlier expedition to the Skyreach Peaks, and their fate remains unknown. Meanwhile, the Archaeologist is keen to prove the shrine’s significance to the Candlekeep scholars who doubted them.
