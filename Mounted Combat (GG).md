**References:** [[Mounted Combat|Mounted Combat]], [[_5e SRD/Animal Handling]]
#### Rationale

I disagree with most of what is printed about mounted combat because riding a horse or other mount is a skill in its own right, as is using weapons and magic. When you take two tasks that require some skill to accomplish and combine them, the difficulty is exponentially increased, in my opinion. For example, putting on makeup while driving: some can do it and get lucky, most eventually fail at one task or another to the detriment of the person and/or vehicle, and few do it well without incident, and even then things go wrong. Just because you are good at swinging a sword, and good at riding a horse, does not mean you are good at swinging a sword while riding a horse.

There should be drawbacks for those who are not experienced at [[Mounted Combat]] and rewards for those who are. Also, being attacked while mounted on an animal or construct puts it at risk. If someone fires an arrow at you while you are on a horse, there is a chance the horse will get hit if you don't.

#### Rulings

1. **Attacks Made While Mounted:**
    - Attacks made while mounted are made with disadvantage. This effect can be counteracted in the following ways:
        - Proficiency with Animal Handling
        - The character takes a feat or subclass that would reasonably counteract this effect (e.g., Cavalier or Samurai subclasses, the Mounted Combatant feat, or any other circumstance your GM deems worthy).
2. **Spooked Mounts:**    
    - Circumstances that arise can cause a mount to become spooked. These circumstances range from an enemy using the fireball spell to moving the mount into difficult terrain. Characters make an Animal Handling check to control their mount.
3. **Spellcaster Concentration:**    
    - Spellcasters lose concentration on a spell when they fail an Animal Handling check to control their mount.
4. **Mounting Costs:**    
    - Mounting costs movement speed based on the mount's size:
        - **Large:** 15 ft.
        - **Huge:** 20 ft.
        - **Gargantuan:** 30 ft.
5. **Mounting Large Creatures:**    
    - Mounting a creature that is Huge or larger requires compliance from the creature and one of the following:
        - Help from another player
        - Any of the special training circumstances mentioned in rule 1.
6. **Attacks Against Riders:**    
    - Attacks made against the rider that match the rider's AC hit the mount.
